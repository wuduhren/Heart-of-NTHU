Heart-of-NTHU Overview
==============================================

Heart-of-NTHU is a datavisualization project of the real data of NTHU Bus Schedule.
I use Python to calculate the "Change Rate" of every building in NTHU through time. 
I Export the result into CSV file, which I can use "Quartz Composer" to do visualization.

Visualization
----------------------------------------------

There are two part of visualization:
  1. Convert the NTHU map into heart-shape, all the vains are roads. The heart rate visualizing the bus-schedule-density.
  2. The rise-and-fall of cubes are the visualization of real data of population in building through time.

Result
